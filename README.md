# Obsidian Semantic Canvas Plugin

> [!tip] There is a [Demo video](https://youtu.be/fI1sWoBZ8yw)!

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) gives canvases the power to edit file properties *visually*.

Set properties for all Markdown files included in your canvas based on their group membership, links to files, links to cards, and links to web embeds. Create new properties or edit existing ones on multiple markdown notes at once through the canvas. Create **semantic links** *(aka typed links or labeled links)* between notes and work with them using an intuitive graph-based approach. Use notes to create canvases. Use canvases to update notes.

### New in V1.2
Now capable of more fine-grained controls:
- Pull properties into existing canvases
- Update properties for individual nodes, rather than all at once
- Option to ignore "alias"/"alises" key 

## Example Screenshots

### Canvas â†’ Edit Note Props
One command to make this canvas...
![Before image](assets/before.png)

...update properties of all the notes it contains:
![After image](assets/after.png)

### Note â†’ Create Canvas
Another command to turn this note...
![Before image](assets/before2.png)

...into a new canvas containing its `list-type` properties:
![After image](assets/after2.png)

## Use Cases
- Building & representing knowledge graphs
- Mass editing properties
- Venn Diagrams & Kanbans

## Usage
This plugin adds functions to the command palette and note/canvas menus. 

Open a canvas then use command palette or file menu to run:
- `Semantic Canvas: Append Note Properties based on canvas` 
    - Will add to note properties without removing any
- `Semantic Canvas: Overwrite Note Properties based on canvas`
    - Will replace note properties
- `Semantic Canvas: Pull in properties for all notes on canvas`
    - Will create new nodes & connections on the canvas based on properties of notes
- `Semantic Canvas: Show existing connections between notes on canvas`
    - Will create new connections (but not nodes) in the canvas based on properties of notes

Open a note then use use command palette or file menu to run:
- `Semantic Canvas: Create canvas based on note`

Right click on nodes in a canvas to:
- `Pull note properties in to canvas`
    - Will create new nodes and arrows to fully represent all the list-type properties for the selected node
- `Show existing connections`
    - Will create new arrows, but not nodes

### Behaviors
> ðŸ“– Node Types  
> Nodes on a canvas are typed as one of `card`, `url`, `file`, or `group`. 

#### Canvas â†’ Edit Note Files
Semantic Canvas modifies properties of **Markdown files** based on how they're connected to nodes (i.e. `files`, `groups`, `cards`, `urls`) in the active Canvas. See the four example screenshots below to see how different canvas situations are turned into properties.

![Behaviors image](assets/behaviors.png)

- Each Node Type behavior can be toggled off.
- If an edge is labeled, the property set on the `file` will use that label as the property key.
- If an edge is unlabeled, the property set on the `file` will use the default label for that node type.
- If a group contains notes, those `files` will have their `groups` (by default) property set to the value of the title(s) of the group(s) the note is contained in.
- If a note is connected to a `group`, it behaves as though the note is connected to every node contained in the group

#### Note â†’ Create Canvas

> ðŸ“‹ Properties are *always* **List**-typed  
> It is not possible to edit Text, Number, Checkbox, Date, or Date & Time properties using this plugin.

Semantic Canvas creates a new canvas file based on the active note. It will be placed in a configurable location, and will graphically represent all `list-type` properties. This canvas could then be edited manually, and those changes can be pushed back to the related notes.
